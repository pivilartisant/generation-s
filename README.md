### 3. Contributing

This application is currenlty under development. If you want to contribute feel free to create an issue and corresponding branch. You also contribute to the documentation by adding to this README.md file which is a good first issue.

By default this repo uses React, but since it's basically html you can creat a simple div like this :


`export function MyDiv () {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>My Div</h1>
        </div>
    )
}`

to style import the css file in the same folder and add the class to the div like this :

`import './myDiv.css'`

and add the class to the div like this :

`export function MyDiv () {
    return (
        <div className="div-one">
            <h1>My Div</h1>
        </div>
    )
}`

### 4. How to use git hub ? 
 In the folder you want to clone the repo using this command (must have git installed on your machine):

 `git clone https://github.com/pivilartisant/generation-s.git` 

After creating an issue on the repo, create a branch in git hub (see picture) :

![Create New Branch Screen](./readmeAssets/createBranch.png)

after that in your code editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc...) open the terminal and type :
` git checkout <branch-name> `
to switch to the branch you just created.

To add code changes to the branch you have to stage the changes using the command :
` git add . `

then commit the changes using the command :
` git commit -m "your commit message" `

then push the changes to the branch using the command :
` git push `

After that you can create a pull request on the repo (see picture) :

![Create New Branch Screen](./readmeAssets/createPr.png)

than follow the instructions and wait for the pull request to be merged.
